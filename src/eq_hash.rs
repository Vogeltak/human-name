/// We can't use more characters of the surname because we treat names as equal
/// when one surname ends with the other and the smaller is at least four
/// characters, to catch cases like "Iria Gayo" == "Iria del RÃ­o Gayo".

/// We can't use the first initial because we might ignore it if someone goes
